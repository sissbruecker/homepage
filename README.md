This is the source code for my [home page](https://sissbruecker.name) showcasing my resume and portfolio.
It's made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which uses React and probably some other neat technologies to create a static website.
Feel free to poke around and see if you find something useful.
